### Sir, this is a WordPress

Dance with the one who brought you

Note:

When you start building something bigger than a typical WP plugin, it can be tempting to build everything like a web app (especially if that's where you're most comfortable), but it's important to remember that you're building within WordPress, which means there are a lot of tools there for you already.

The MU plugin adds a lot, especially with the DI container, but it's still a WordPress plugin: we're using actions and filters, working with options and user meta, registering settings pages, etc. We're not sidestepping the WP REST API, creating our own hook system, or anything else that already exists and works well: don't reinvent the wheel
