### Documentation is crucial

If you've added hooks for the customer, make sure they know about them!

Note:

When we build the plugin, we include two markdown files in the root of the plugin's directory: a copy of the changelog (including the release date for each version) and a README that covers what the MU plugin is, all of the publicly-available hooks (with examples), our deprecation policy.

The README also warns customers that the undocumented hooks are not officially supported and may change at any time. This sets expectations around what *can* and *cannot* change.
