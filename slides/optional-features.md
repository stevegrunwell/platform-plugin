Not everyone wants or needs every feature,<br>and that's okay

Note:

A lot of the MU plugin is to help optimize customer sites, but some features are add-ons.

Example: plugin installer, which collects both free and premium plugins for one-click installation and licensing. Great for customers who run their own site and want to take advantage of premium plugins we're offering as part of their plan, but can be a liability for agencies who try to lock things down.

To this end, we provide filters to let developers disable these features if they choose.
