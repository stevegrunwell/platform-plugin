### Awesome, Modern Tooling

* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Package managers (Composer, npm, etc.)
* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Build tools (webpack)
* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Automate whatever you can!

Remember that the tooling is there to help you produce the best outcome, so use whatever tools will help you most, and automate whatever you can.
