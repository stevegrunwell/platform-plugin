### Our goals

1. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->Look at the plugin architecture
2. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->Discuss what works (and what doesn't)
3. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->Provide lessons that can be applied to plugins of any size

Note:

This isn't an hour of "hey, look at this thing I've built", because that doesn't help anyone except maybe my ego.

Instead, I want to show how we've arrived where we have, talk about what works (and some missteps along the way), and ultimately extract some lessons that you can take to our own plugins (regardless of size).

Some of these topics could be talks in themselves, so the README in the GitHub repo for these slides is chock-full of further reading and references.
