### Challenges of Building<br>a Managed Platform

1. <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Every site is different
2. <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Not every customer gets every feature
3. <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> We're pushing changes to <u>a lot</u> of sites ðŸ˜¬
4. <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> We never want to be the bottleneck

Note:

1. Every site is going to have its own combination of themes, plugins, and configurations â€”Â how do we accommodate them all?
2. Certain features might only be available on higher plans, or could be specific to WooCommerce â€”Â how do we toggle these off without releasing dozens of different variants of our solution?
3. The solution will impact tens of thousands of sites, so we need to take measures not to break anything
4. One of the major advantages we tout about our platform is performance, so we need to take extra care not to negatively impact the site performance
