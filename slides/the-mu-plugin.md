### Meet Nexcess MAPPS

* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Must-use (MU) plugin installed across all WordPress, WooCommerce, and [StoreBuilder](https://www.nexcess.net/storebuilder/) sites
* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> A central location for all of our tweaks and features
* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Behavior varies based on environment

Note:

Nexcess Managed Applications, or "MAPPS" is the name of the platform within the company

Installed automatically any time the platform provisions a new WordPress/Woo/StoreBuilder site, and automatically updated

Instead of pre-installing a bunch of plugins, we can bundle items essential to the platform, then intelligently turn them on and off
