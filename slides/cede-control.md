### Let them make their own choices

They grow up so fast! ðŸ˜¢

Note:

Customers have chosen us, but not necessarily all of the features we roll out â€”Â kind of the trade-off in managed hosting. We want to keep pushing features, but not everyone wants all of them.

We do what we can to give our customers a solid starting point, so full-page caching, a redis-backed object cache, and a performant theme will all be installed out-of-the-box.

If you migrate over, or you've been building sites for years and have a particular set of plugins you rely on, we shouldn't be getting in your way.

MU plugin even includes some code to deactivate integrations/features if you're running something else that does the same job; along with good defaults, it's our responsibility to get out of the way when the customer tries to make alternative options.
