### Declare minimum versions

Limit your scope, reduce your stress

Note:

Next, we need to define what our minimum supported versions will be. It could be a PHP version, a version of WordPress, or even a particular plugin version, but determine where you say "use at your own risk".

Furthermore, be ready to raise that minimum down the road — just because you support PHP 5.6 right now doesn't mean you should six months from now.

In the MU plugin, we won't load the MU plugin for customers running anything below WP 5.0; instead, we display a notice that points out "hey, you're missing out on the benefits of your plan, so please upgrade"
